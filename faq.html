      <h3 class="text">Is is save?</h3>
      <p class="text">The programm itself is very save, because it runs only java and html(with css and js) wich is written from our most trust developers and me! The browser works most simular as TOR, so its saver as let's say Microsoft Edge</p>
      <h3 class="text">Is there a chronik?</h3>
      <p class="text">If you didn't activate some plugins, there's no chronik, because our developers work hard every day for coding a systhem that NOBODY can see what you do in hoppernet especially for our browser</p>
      <h3 class="text">Why should I use Hoppernet?</h3>
      <p class="text">Hoppernet is a browser program with many special features - lets compare it with windows text editor and intellij. The simple windows text editor(browser: Microsoft Edge) works pretti good, but if you want to do some more like coding stuff, it's nit the best. So Hoppernet is also a browser with many special features. If you are in an online-shop for example, you can see, wich people you can trust.
