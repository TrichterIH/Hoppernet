      <h3 class="text">Is is save?</h3>
      <p class="text">The programm itself is very save, because it runs only java and html(with css and js) wich is written from our most trust developers and me! The browser works most simular as TOR, so its saver as let's say Microsoft Edge</p>
      <h3 class="text">Is there a chronik?</h3>
      <p class="text">If you didn't activate some plugins, there's no chronik, because our developers work hard every day for coding a systhem that NOBODY can see what you do in hoppernet especially for our browser</p>
